/**
 * SONIX-Model v6.0.0 — PATTERN ENGINE EDITION
 * =============================================
 * Core Philosophy:
 *   Words connect. Patterns build. Language flows.
 *   Every user message is processed as a pattern —
 *   the model reads it, maps the words, and builds
 *   a real, non-repeating, contextual response.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   <script src="https://raw.githack.com/YOUR/REPO/main/sonix-model.js"></script>
 *   SonixModel.chat("how to throw") => Promise<string>
 *   SonixModel.chat("what is courage") => Promise<string>
 *   SonixModel.chat("go slow") => Promise<string>
 *
 * KEY FEATURES v6:
 *   - PATTERN ENGINE: reads word sequences, builds structured answers
 *     how+to+[verb]   → step-by-step guide
 *     what+is+[noun]  → definition + description
 *     why+[verb/noun] → reasoning + cause
 *     when+to+[verb]  → timing + conditions
 *     where+[verb]    → location + context
 *     who+[verb/noun] → identity + role
 *     [word]+vs+[word]→ comparison
 *     how+[adj]       → degree/manner guide
 *     go+[adj/adv]    → action guide (go slow, go hard)
 *   - WORD CONNECTION GRAPH: 10,000+ words, 120 categories
 *   - NO PERSONAS — one adaptive intelligent voice
 *   - NO HARDCODED NAMES
 *   - DYNAMIC RESPONSE BUILDER — never repeats
 *   - VERB ENGINE: conjugation, usage, forms
 *   - NOUN ENGINE: describe, relate, categorize
 *   - ADJECTIVE ENGINE: intensity, comparison, context
 *   - SENTENCE ASSEMBLER: builds natural language from parts
 *   - LIVE RESEARCH: Wikipedia + DuckDuckGo + Dictionary API
 *   - FULL MATH, UNIT CONVERSION, CALCULATORS
 *   - EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE — 12 states
 *   - 500+ IDIOMS, 200+ ETYMOLOGIES, 600+ SYNONYMS

Master the fundamentals slowly and speed will follow naturally.",
    "go fast":    "Speed matters when:\n• The window of opportunity is narrow\n• You need momentum to break through resistance\n• Speed itself is a competitive advantage\n• Done is better than perfect in this context\n\n**The principle:** go fast where speed creates value. Go slow where mistakes compound.",
    "go hard":    "Going hard means maximum commitment and effort. Apply this when:\n• You need a breakthrough\n• A deadline is real and immovable\n• Half-effort will produce no result\n• You have rested and are prepared\n\n**The principle:** sustainability matters. Go hard in sprints, not forever.",
    "go easy":    "Going easy is smart, not lazy — it means:\n• Pacing yourself for the long game\n• Recovering when recovery is needed\n• Not over-engineering a simple problem\n• Being gentle when gentleness is what works\n\n**The principle:** match your intensity to what the situation actually demands.",
    "go deep":    "Going deep means:\n• Understanding root causes, not just surface symptoms\n• Developing mastery rather than surface knowledge\n• Investing time to truly understand one thing\n• Asking why five times instead of once\n\n**The principle:** depth compounds. A deep understanding of few things beats shallow knowledge of many.",
    "go big":     "Going big means:\n• Setting ambitious goals that stretch your capability\n• Taking risks that match the potential reward\n• Committing fully instead of hedging\n• Building for scale from the beginning\n\n**The principle:** big thinking attracts big results — but big execution is what actually produces them.",
    "go small":   "Going small means:\n• Starting with the minimum viable version\n• Testing before scaling\n• Finding the simplest solution that works\n• Doing one thing extremely well before adding more\n\n**The principle:** small actions consistently applied build large outcomes over time.",
    "go low":     "Going low means:\n• Staying humble and grounded\n• Keeping overhead and complexity minimal\n• Flying under the radar when that is the advantage\n• Reducing to essentials\n\n**The principle:** low friction, low ego, high output.",
    "go high":    "Going high means:\n• Elevating your standards\n• Taking the moral or ethical high ground\n• Aiming for excellence over adequacy\n• Thinking at a higher level of abstraction\n\n**The principle:** go high in standards; stay grounded in execution.",
    "go back":    "Going back means:\n• Revisiting a decision or assumption that may be wrong\n• Returning to fundamentals when advanced approaches fail\n• Reconnecting with original intent\n• Undoing something before it compounds\n\n**The principle:** going back is not failure — it is course correction.",
    "go forward": "Going forward means:\n• Moving past what has already happened\n• Committing to the next action regardless of past results\n• Treating the present as the starting line\n• Building momentum through consistent motion\n\n**The principle:** you cannot change the past. You can only build forward from now.",

// Rich word descriptions (used for define/describe/explain)
const WORD_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  "courage":    "The ability to act despite fear. Courage is not the absence of anxiety — it is choosing to move forward anyway. It shows up in big moments and small ones, in public and in private, in words and in action. The bravest thing is often the simplest: being honest when honesty is uncomfortable.",
  "resilience": "The capacity to recover, adapt, and keep going after difficulty. Resilience is not about avoiding pain — it is about moving through it without letting it define you. It is built, not born, and grows stronger every time you face something hard and come out the other side.",
  "discipline": "The practice of doing what needs to be done even when you do not feel like it. Discipline is the bridge between goals and achievement. It is not punishment — it is the commitment to your future self over your current comfort. Everything meaningful is built through it.",
  "creativity": "The ability to connect ideas in unexpected ways to produce something original. Everyone is creative — the practice just looks different for different people. Creativity requires space, silence, and the freedom to be wrong. It grows with use and withers with fear.",
  "leadership": "The act of guiding others toward a shared goal. True leadership is less about authority and more about service, trust, and showing up consistently. A leader's real output is capability in others — not what they do, but what they enable.",
  "love":       "A deep connection, commitment, and care for someone or something. Love is both a feeling and a choice — a verb as much as a noun. It is expressed through attention, consistency, and showing up — not just in words.",
  "freedom":    "The state of being able to act, think, and speak without constraint. True freedom comes with responsibility — the freedom to choose also means the accountability for those choices. Freedom is not the absence of structure; it is the presence of meaningful choice.",
  "success":    "The achievement of a meaningful goal. Success is personal — what counts as success varies from person to person and changes across time. The most dangerous definition of success is someone else's.",
  "failure":    "The result of an attempt that did not reach its goal. More importantly, failure is information — it points exactly at what needs to change. Every person who has built something remarkable has a catalog of failures that preceded it.",
  "time":       "The most finite and valuable resource anyone has. Unlike money, it cannot be earned back. How you spend your time is how you spend your life. The question is not whether you have enough time — it is whether your priorities match what you say matters.",
  "trust":      "The foundation of every meaningful relationship and organization. It is built slowly through consistent action and broken quickly through a single deception. Trust is the currency of real influence.",
  "growth":     "The ongoing process of becoming more capable, aware, and effective. Growth is often uncomfortable because it requires letting go of who you were. The most reliable sign of growth is not confidence — it is the willingness to be a beginner again.",
  "purpose":    "The deep sense of why you do what you do. Purpose gives ordinary actions extraordinary meaning. It is not discovered by waiting — it is revealed by doing, reflecting, and paying attention to what lights you up.",
  "patience":   "The ability to endure delay, difficulty, or uncertainty without losing composure. Patience is not passive waiting — it is active trust that things will develop in their own time. It is one of the rarest and most valuable forms of strength.",
  "focus":      "The concentrated direction of attention and energy toward a specific outcome. In a world of infinite distraction, focus has become the scarcest resource. It is built through environment design, clear priorities, and the repeated practice of returning when you drift.",
  "change":     "The constant reorganization of reality. Change is neutral — what matters is whether you navigate it intentionally or get swept by it reactively. The most adaptable people are not those who love change — they are those who stay grounded within it.",
  "fear":       "An emotional response to perceived threat. Fear protects us, but it also limits us. The key is learning to distinguish between fear that is a real warning and fear that is just resistance — showing up because something important is at stake.",
  "hope":       "The belief that a better outcome is possible. Hope is not passive — it is the fuel that makes effort feel worthwhile. It is not the same as certainty, and that is exactly its power: it moves us toward something before we can prove it will work.",
  "truth":      "Alignment between a statement and reality. Truth is simple to define and often difficult to face. The practice of truth — in communication, in thinking, in self-assessment — is one of the most powerful tools available.",
  "communication": "The process of creating shared understanding between two or more people. Communication is not just speaking — it is ensuring you have been understood. The best communicators listen as much as they talk, and they care more about clarity than cleverness.",
  "silence":    "The absence of sound — and the presence of everything else. Silence is where clarity, creativity, and self-awareness often live. Most people are uncomfortable with silence, which is why most people miss what it offers.",
  "choice":     "The act of selecting between alternatives. Every choice carries weight because it always includes what you did not choose. The quality of your life is largely the sum of your choices — including the choice of how you respond to what you cannot control.",
  "mind":       "The center of thought, feeling, memory, and consciousness. The mind is both the tool you use and the lens through which you see everything. Training it — through learning, reflection, and intentional practice — is the highest-leverage investment available.",
  "body":       "The physical vehicle through which you experience the world. Your body carries your history, enables your future, and communicates information your conscious mind often misses. It responds to how you treat it with remarkable precision.",
  "story":      "A sequence of events with meaning attached. Stories are how humans make sense of the world — every culture runs on narrative. The story you tell about yourself shapes your actions more than almost any other factor.",
  "community":  "A group of people bound by shared values, experiences, or goals. Community provides belonging, accountability, and collective strength. Humans are social creatures — isolation is not strength, and connection is not weakness.",
